## Call me Nat!

I'm an educator and aspiring data analyst looking to apply and expand my knowledge of statistical methodologies.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a dashboard that allows users to create visualizations using REDCap patient data, employing the [RosyREDCap](https://github.com/brandonerose/RosyREDCap), [plotly](https://plotly.com/r/), and [flexdashboard](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/flexdashboard/index.html) R packages
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R package development and relational database design with PostgreSQL and Python
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on complex data analyses
- 🍎 Check out my lessons on [negative binomial regression](https://gabriel.quarto.pub/an-r-cookbook-for-public-health/lessons/05_glm_negative_binomial.html) and [two-way ANOVAs](https://gabriel.quarto.pub/an-r-cookbook-for-public-health/lessons/04_anova_two_way.html) in R!
